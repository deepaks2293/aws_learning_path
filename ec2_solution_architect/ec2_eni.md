ENI (Elastic Network Interface) is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance in your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). It allows your EC2 instance to communicate with other resources in your VPC or with the internet.

In this blog, we will discuss the basics of ENI, how it works, and its use cases.

What is ENI?

An ENI is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. It can be created and attached to an EC2 instance to enable network communication. Each ENI can have a primary private IP address, one or more secondary private IP addresses, and one or more public IP addresses. You can also attach security groups to an ENI to control inbound and outbound traffic.

How ENI works?

When you launch an EC2 instance, it comes with a default network interface attached to it. However, you can attach additional ENIs to the instance. Each ENI is assigned a MAC address, which is used to identify the network interface. When you attach an ENI to an instance, the instance must have the necessary drivers and software to support the network interface.

An ENI can be attached to an instance at launch time or added later. If you add an ENI later, you must first create it, then attach it to the instance. You can detach an ENI from an instance and attach it to a different instance.

Use Cases of ENI:

ENI has several use cases in AWS, some of which are:

    High availability: You can attach multiple ENIs to an instance to provide high availability. If one ENI fails, traffic can be redirected to another ENI.

    Multi-homed instances: ENI allows you to create an EC2 instance with multiple network interfaces, each with a different IP address.

    Network traffic control: You can use ENI to control network traffic in and out of your EC2 instance by attaching security groups to the network interface.

    Network packet capture: You can attach an ENI to an EC2 instance for network packet capture, which is useful for troubleshooting and monitoring.

Conclusion:

ENI is a crucial component of AWS networking, enabling communication between EC2 instances and other resources in your VPC or the internet. By understanding how ENI works and its use cases, you can make the most of this feature in your AWS infrastructure.
