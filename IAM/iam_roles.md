IAM Roles: An Overview

IAM roles are a feature of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) that allow AWS resources to be accessed by trusted entities. IAM roles are similar to IAM users, but instead of being associated with a specific set of security credentials, they are intended to be assumed by trusted entities such as AWS services, applications running on EC2 instances, and external user accounts.

An IAM role defines the permissions that are required to access AWS resources. The permissions are defined in an IAM policy, which is attached to the role. When an entity assumes the role, it temporarily assumes the permissions defined in the attached policy.

There are two types of IAM roles:

    EC2 roles: These roles are intended to be assumed by EC2 instances. They are used to grant an EC2 instance access to AWS resources, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon RDS.

    Identity provider roles: These roles are intended to be assumed by external user accounts, such as those managed by a company's internal identity provider or a third-party identity provider such as Amazon Cognito or Login with Amazon.

Creating an IAM role is a simple process. First, navigate to the IAM dashboard in the AWS Management Console. Then, click on the “Roles” link in the left-side menu, and click the “Create role” button. Next, choose the type of role you want to create and follow the steps to attach a policy and specify the trusted entities.

In conclusion, IAM roles are an important feature of AWS IAM that allow trusted entities to access AWS resources. They are easy to create and can be used to grant access to AWS resources to EC2 instances, external user accounts, and other trusted entities. By using IAM roles, you can ensure that AWS resources are accessed securely and with the appropriate level of permissions.
