AWS Access Keys, CLI and SDK: Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console

The first step to access AWS resources programmatically is to log in to the AWS Management Console. To do this, go to the AWS website and enter your AWS account credentials.

Step 2: Create an IAM user

Once logged in, navigate to the IAM dashboard. This is where you will create a new IAM user. To do this, click on the “Users” link in the left-side menu, then click the “Add user” button.

Step 3: Assign Access Type

Choose the type of access the new IAM user should have. The options are AWS Management Console access and Programmatic access. Choose Programmatic access and click the “Next” button.

Step 4: Attach a policy

Next, attach a policy to the IAM user. This policy will determine what actions the user can perform. For the purpose of this guide, we will attach the AmazonS3FullAccess policy, which allows full access to Amazon S3. You can attach a custom policy if desired.

Step 5: Create Access Keys

Click on the “Create access key” button to generate the access key ID and secret access key. The secret access key will be displayed only once, so be sure to save it in a secure location.

Step 6: Install the AWS CLI

The AWS CLI is a command-line interface for interacting with AWS services. To install it, follow the instructions provided on the AWS CLI website.

Step 7: Configure the AWS CLI

Once the AWS CLI is installed, you can configure it to use your AWS access keys. To do this, run the following command:


aws configure


You will be prompted to enter your access key ID, secret access key, default region name, and default output format.

Step 8: Use the AWS CLI

You are now ready to use the AWS CLI to access AWS resources. For example, to list the contents of an S3 bucket, run the following command:

aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>

Step 9: Install the AWS SDK

The AWS SDK is a collection of libraries and tools that makes it easier to develop applications that use AWS services. To install the AWS SDK, follow the instructions provided on the AWS SDK website for your programming language of choice.

Step 10: Use the AWS SDK

You can now use the AWS SDK in your application to access AWS resources. The SDK provides a programming interface for interacting with AWS services, and the syntax will vary based on the programming language you are using.

In conclusion, AWS access keys, the CLI, and the SDK provide different ways to access AWS resources programmatically. By following these steps, you can create an IAM user, generate access keys, and use the AWS CLI and SDK to access AWS resources.
