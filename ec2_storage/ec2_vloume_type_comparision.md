    General Purpose SSD (gp2): This volume type provides a baseline of 3 IOPS per GB, up to a maximum of 16,000 IOPS per volume. It also allows for bursts of up to 3,000 IOPS for short periods of time.

    General Purpose SSD (gp3): This is a newer generation of gp2 volume type and provides a better price-performance ratio than gp2. gp3 volumes provide a baseline of 3 IOPS per GB, up to a maximum of 16,000 IOPS per volume, like gp2. However, gp3 volumes also have a baseline throughput of 125 MB/s per TB, which increases linearly as the volume size increases, up to a maximum of 1,000 MB/s per volume.

    Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1): This volume type allows you to specify the number of IOPS you need, up to a maximum of 64,000 IOPS per volume. The minimum IOPS per volume is 100, and the maximum throughput is 1,000 MB/s.

    Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): This volume type provides a baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB, up to a maximum of 500 MB/s per volume. The minimum volume size is 500 GB, and the maximum size is 16 TB.

    Cold HDD (sc1): This volume type provides a baseline throughput of 12 MB/s per TB, up to a maximum of 250 MB/s per volume. The minimum volume size is 500 GB, and the maximum size is 16 TB.

As you can see, the different EBS volume types have different IOPS specifications, and you can choose the volume type that best fits your workload's performance and cost requirements. General Purpose SSD volumes are a good choice for most workloads, while Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes are ideal for workloads that require high performance and low latency, and Throughput Optimized HDD and Cold HDD volumes are ideal for workloads that require high throughput and infrequent access.
