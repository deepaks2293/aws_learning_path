An EC2 instance store is a type of temporary storage that is available on certain types of EC2 instances. Unlike Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), which provides persistent block storage, instance store volumes are temporary and are lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.

Here are some of the pros and cons of using EC2 instance store:

Pros:

    High performance: Instance store volumes are physically attached to the host computer and provide high-speed, low-latency storage. This makes them ideal for applications that require high I/O performance, such as databases or big data workloads.

    Low cost: Instance store volumes are included in the cost of the instance, so there are no additional charges for storage. This makes them a cost-effective option for workloads that require temporary storage.

    Simple setup: Instance store volumes are automatically attached to instances when they are launched, so there is no additional setup required.

Cons:

    Limited durability: Instance store volumes are not durable and are lost when the instance is stopped or terminated. This means that they are not suitable for storing data that needs to be persisted across instance lifetimes.

    Limited capacity: The size of instance store volumes is limited, and varies depending on the instance type. This means that they may not be suitable for applications that require large amounts of storage.

    Limited availability: Not all instance types support instance store volumes. If you need to use instance store volumes, you will need to choose an instance type that supports them.

In terms of what EC2 instance store can do, it can be used to provide high-speed, low-latency storage for applications that require high I/O performance. It can also be used to store temporary data, such as logs or temporary files, that does not need to be persisted across instance lifetimes.

However, there are also limitations to what EC2 instance store can do. It is not suitable for storing data that needs to be persisted across instance lifetimes, and it may not be suitable for applications that require large amounts of storage.

In summary, EC2 instance store provides high-speed, low-latency storage that is ideal for certain types of workloads. However, it is not suitable for all use cases, and it's important to understand its limitations before deciding whether to use it.
