    Standard: The standard storage class is designed for workloads that require low-latency access to frequently accessed files. This storage class provides high performance, high availability, and durability, making it an ideal choice for applications that require fast access to frequently accessed data. Standard storage is also ideal for workloads that require burst performance, as it can automatically scale to meet the needs of your application.

    Infrequent Access (IA): The Infrequent Access storage class is designed for workloads that require less frequent access to data, but still need low-latency performance. This storage class provides cost savings by reducing the storage costs for files that are infrequently accessed. However, there is a retrieval fee for accessing data stored in the IA storage class.

    One Zone Infrequent Access (OZ-IA): The One Zone Infrequent Access storage class is similar to the IA storage class but is designed to be used in a single Availability Zone. This storage class is ideal for workloads that can tolerate data loss in the event of an Availability Zone failure and require infrequent access to data. This storage class provides cost savings by reducing the storage costs for files that are infrequently accessed in a single Availability Zone.

    Intelligent Tiering: The Intelligent Tiering storage class is designed for workloads that have changing access patterns over time. It automatically moves files between the standard and infrequent access storage classes based on their access patterns. This storage class provides cost savings by automatically moving files that are infrequently accessed to the Infrequent Access storage class.

The choice of EFS storage class depends on your application's needs and the access patterns of your data. If you need high performance, high availability, and durability for frequently accessed files, the Standard storage class is the best choice. If you have infrequently accessed data and want to reduce storage costs, the Infrequent Access or One Zone Infrequent Access storage classes may be the right choice. If you have changing access patterns over time and want to optimize costs, the Intelligent Tiering storage class may be the best choice.
