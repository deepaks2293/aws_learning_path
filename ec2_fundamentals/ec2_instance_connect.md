EC2 Instance Connect is a secure and easy-to-use method for connecting to Linux instances running on Amazon EC2. EC2 Instance Connect eliminates the need to use a bastion host or to open inbound SSH ports to your instances.

With EC2 Instance Connect, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SSH clients to securely connect to your instances using short-lived, signed SSH certificates. These certificates are automatically provisioned by EC2 Instance Connect and provide secure access to your instances without the need for a permanent public/private key pair.

To use EC2 Instance Connect, you must first ensure that your instance is running a supported version of the Amazon Linux or Ubuntu operating system. You can then use one of the following methods to connect to your instance:

    AWS Management Console: Using the EC2 Instance Connect feature in the AWS Management Console, you can connect to your instance with just a few clicks. Simply select the instance you want to connect to, click the "Connect" button, and choose the "EC2 Instance Connect" option.

    AWS CLI: Using the AWS CLI, you can connect to your instance using the "aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key" command. This command sends your public SSH key to the specified instance, which can then be used to create a short-lived SSH certificate for authentication.

    SSH Clients: If you prefer to use an SSH client, you can use the EC2 Instance Connect CLI to retrieve a short-lived SSH certificate, which can then be used to connect to your instance using your preferred SSH client.

Overall, EC2 Instance Connect is a secure and easy-to-use method for connecting to Linux instances running on Amazon EC2, without the need for a permanent public/private key pair or inbound SSH ports.
